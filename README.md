Storage Provider(SP) are storage service infrastructure providers. SPs stores client's real data in its IPFS storage, and provide plenty of convenient services for users and dApps to read and write data.

SPs have to stake and register themselves on chain first. Blockchain concensus governs the storage task election among all SPs. SPs have duty to store client's storage deal in complete storage deal lifecycle.

Each SP should have a good connection with blockchain network by maintaining their own full node.
